                        <p>Chronic pain is described as pain that is prevalent for more than 12 weeks in spite of medication and treatment. Over 25 percent of adults in the United States will experience chronic pain in their lifetimes. Although I have not experienced it myself, my grandmother recently passed away from a year-long battle with cancer, and through her battle, I saw the dreadful effect that chronic pain has on an individual. She had an ever-increasing prescription of opiates to numb the pain and this caused the side effects of the pills to increase as well. This prompted me to wonder about possible alternatives to traditional painkillers.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Rise of Medicinal Marijuana
                        </h2>
                        <p>As of February 2022, medicinal marijuana is legal in 37 out of 50 states, and it is likely that the trend toward federal legalization will continue. Medicinal marijuana is administered in a variety of ways including nasal sprays, in pill form or through ingestion (Hill). Yet, despite the proliferation of cannabis in the United States, it is still federally regarded as a schedule 1 drug. This makes it very difficult to study the drug due to a multitude of guidelines and the difficulty of obtaining grant money for the research (Pass).</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Dangers of Medicinal Marijuana
                        </h2>
                        <p>Before discussing the potential benefits of cannabis, it is important to outline some of the dangers associated with using the drug. In one study, 5 out of 36 subjects experienced extreme levels of anxiety as a result of using cannabis and were excluded from the rest of the study (Joy et. al). There are also dangers associated with driving under the influence of marijuana as well as dangers of addiction. 17 percent of teens and 9 percent of adult cannabis users experience severe disruptions from school, work and relationships due to the substance (Hill).

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Medicinal Marijuana for Chronic pain</h2>
                        <p>Although studies of medicinal marijuana have been limited, there is evidence that it is effective in treating chronic pain in some individuals. One study that looked at chronic pain in cancer patients noted that just 20 milligrams of cannabis was enough to fully ease the pain of patients. The study later concluded that 10 milligrams of cannabis was just as effective as 60 milligrams of codeine, a strong opiate (Joy et. al). Another study found that although cannabis was not fully effective at easing the back pain of a patient, the combination of relaxation and serenity that it provided helped the patient deal with the pain better than he could otherwise (Hill). This indicates that the benefits of cannabis can extend beyond just the capabilities of it to ease oneâ€™s pain.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Marijuana as a substitute for opiates
                        </h2>
                        <p>It is no question that opiates are dangerous. The rate of opioid abuse in the United States has skyrocketed, and a new wave of popularity for synthetic opioids like fentanyl has greatly increased the amounts of drug overdoses in the nation. I believe that one of the ways that this could be combated is by reducing the amount of opiates that are prescribed, and by finding alternative methods of dealing with chronic pain. As medicinal marijuana is studied more, we will soon get a clearer picture of the benefits and drawbacks of the substance. Thus, it is important to keep our minds open to new possibilities and new ways of treating pain.
